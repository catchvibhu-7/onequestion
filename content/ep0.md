Mid-August.

A fresh batch of engineering students 
— Civil, Electronics, Mechanical — 
are packed into a classroom for orientation. Everyone is nervous. Everyone is pretending not to be.

I have already given my introduction and am now doing what I do best in unfamiliar environments,
existing silently and hoping no one notices me.

Then a girl from a distant land introduces herself.

***Calm.
Confident.
Elegant.***

I am mesmerised — along with roughly twenty other guys.

But my brain does something extra.

It goes:

**<u>“Oh!”</u>**

**<u>“SO THATS MY TYPE.”</u>**

No planning.
No expectations.

Just one very clear thought:

I want to be her friend.

And just like that, the long-term damage begins.

This is a story that **V** and **P** have shared for a little over nine years.

Told entirely from V’s side. 

It contains memories, mistakes, missed chances, and jokes that somehow survived all of that. For the sake of the story,

V will occasionally be referred to as **"I"**. 

This is intentional. Also lazy. 

I hope you enjoy this. And yes — the bad puns stays.

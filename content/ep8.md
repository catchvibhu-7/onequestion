Final year begins.

Things are… good.

I’m happy with our friendship, stable in my relationship.

No awkwardness. No tension.

Then the world stops.

Covid happens.

Campuses shut down.
Goodbyes, happen without warning.

I go home.

She goes to an isolation centre in her town.

We share snaps. Every day.

I don’t know why those stuck with me.

But they did.

Life resumes, slowly.

I get employed.

She’s preparing for her next step.

We had to clear our college deposits.

I’m glad I was able to help her with that.

It feelt good — being useful.

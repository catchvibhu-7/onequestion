After almost a year of not really talking,

and realising P still occupies a permanent section of my brain.

I decide avoidance has officially stopped working.

I choose courage.

Or desperation.

Or both.

I decide to talk to P again.

Yes — I discussed this with my girlfriend at the time.

The logic was simple (and flawed),

**If I become friends with P again, I’ll finally get over her.**

Also, I have a girlfriend, so obviously no funny business.

(Narrator's voice: He was wrong. So wrong.)

After many failed walk-pasts and aborted conversations…

P’s birthday arrives.

She’s walks past me.

***“Hey!”***

She turns.

**“Hey, V. Long time.”**

with every ounce of everything I had, I say.

***“HAPPY BIRTHDAY P.”***

She smiles,
says thank you.

And hugs me.

That’s it.

That’s all it took.

The awkwardness evaporates.
My nervous system resets.

**The Great Reset.**

Things don’t go back to normal instantly — but they do, eventually.

That’s why, I never forget her birthday.

It’s special to me in a way. I’ve never explained before.

Lunches,
Conversations,
Comfort returns.

I’m happy.

Sometimes jealous — because during our time apart, she grew closer to others and I felt a little left behind.

But that’s on me.

She keeps some distance.
So do I.

I keep my feelings on a leash.

Mostly.

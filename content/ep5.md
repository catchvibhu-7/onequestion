First year ends.

P decides she might move out of the hostel and into a flat near college.

Nothing is confirmed yet, but preparations begin anyway.

So I do what good friends do.

I help her and her friends move their luggage to the taxi.

The bags are heavy.
Physics is unclear.
Somehow, I break one of them.

To this day, I still don’t understand how it happened.

I panic. I scramble. I try to fix it.

She notices.

She doesn’t say anything.

Which, in hindsight, feels like a summary of our story so far!

Something breaks.

She notices.

She let me keep my dignity.

And then she leaves.

Just like that.
Summer happens.

We don’t talk.

I wanted to. 

I tried. Words din't come out.

I don’t know how.

Second year begins.

Our classes get separated.

We grow apart — mostly because I revert to my default coping mechanism,

Avoidance disguised as maturity.

I watch her from afar.

Time passes.

We still keep in touch. But Less.

Every time I see a message from her, I smile like an idiot — quietly, to myself.

What stays isn’t loud.
It isn’t dramatic.

It’s subtle.
Persistent.
It just… stays.

I have said this before — I am not a fan of long-distance.

That opinion came from experience, trial, and a few avoidable mistakes.

But here’s the truth I can no longer dodge,

If it is her, distance doesn’t feel like a reason anymore.

And somewhere along the way, one question started coming back to me.

So… who was infatuated?

Definitely not me. 

(And yes, I am absolutely not letting this go.)

This isn’t pressure.
It isn’t expectation.

It’s just honesty.

Nine years later —
before it becomes a decade —

I guess you know what comes next!

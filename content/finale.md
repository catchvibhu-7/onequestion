Time passes.

We still talk.

Every time I see a message from P, I smile like an idiot — quietly, to myself.

What stays isn’t loud.
It isn’t dramatic.

It’s subtle.
Persistent.
It just… stays.

I have said this before — I am not a fan of long-distance.
That opinion came from experience, trial, and a few avoidable mistakes.

But here’s the truth I can no longer dodge:

If it is you, distance doesn’t feel like a reason anymore.

And somewhere along the way, one question started coming back to me.

So… who was infatuated?
(Definitely not me. And yes, I am absolutely not letting this go.)

This isn’t pressure.
It isn’t expectation.

It’s just honesty.

Nine years later —
before it becomes a decade —

Pema Lhamu Tamang,

Would you like to be my girlfriend?

If the answer is no, I will respect it completely.
I just didn’t want to look back one day and regret not asking.

And if the answer is yes —
then I’ll go all in.

Maybe we finally get to write Part Two together this time.

Report Card:
You pass.


— Fin

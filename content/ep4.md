By now, we are attending birthday parties together.

We are comfortable.

Then my birthday arrives.

Of course, I invite her.

We party.

I drink a little.

I am a low-capacity drinker, so a little alcohol does a lot.

Not drunk.
Just… dangerously confident.

That evening, it is just the two of us walking around.

Nice weather.
Good air.

No plan.
Too sudden.
Too brave.

I tell her: 

***hey P i have been trying to tell you something, but i cant hold it back..***

She is visible confused and says 

***"ahaa say"***

***I think I like you***

She does not feel the same way.

I am heartbroken.

She tries to soften it.

She says:

**“You don’t like me. You’re just infatuated.”**

I accept defeat.

We say Bye. I go back to my room.

I take my phone and search the word ***<u>INFATUATION</u>*** in the dictionary.

I feel physical pain from the heart break.

and mental pain for not knowing the word.

I still tell this story to my friends.
It has not aged well.

But I do not want to disappear from her life.

So I swallow my pride, bury the topic, and continue being her friend.

Emotionally mature?
Debatable.

Sincere?
Absolutely.

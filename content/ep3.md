December arrives.

Around this time, I repeatedly bother M to convince P to come have dinner with us.

I bother her too.

Eventually, she gives up.

She and her friends join us sometimes.

Progress. Development. Character arc unlocked.

One evening, I find P sitting alone in the canteen.

I sit with her.

We talk.

I open Snapchat.

I discover she uses Snapchat too.

She takes my phone.

She takes photos.

We take one horrible, filter-filled picture together.

It was ugly.

It was tragic.

***The picture should not exist.***

It was the only photo of the two of us together.

I will never delete it. NEVER.

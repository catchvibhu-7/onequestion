The clock still ticks.

P decides to pursue her master’s.

I decide to support her, however I can.

Her visa appointment is due, that too in town familiar to us both.

I’m excited.

I plan everything.
Buy gifts.
Almost book a hotel.

Then her plans change.

A slot opens earlier.

I can’t get a leave.

We don’t meet.

I’m sad again.

<u>I still keep the gift with me.</u>

For a day that hasn’t happened yet.

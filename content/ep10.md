P decides to pursue her Master’s.

I decide to support her however I can.

Her visa appointment is in Kolkata.

I’m excited.

I plan everything.
Buy gifts.
Almost book a hotel.

Then her plans change.

A slot opens earlier.

I can’t get leave.

We don’t meet.

I’m heartbroken.

I still keep the gift with me.

For a day that hasn’t happened yet.

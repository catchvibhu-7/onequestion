(Also known as V’s Villain Origin Story)

A few weeks pass. Classes begin. Friendships form — both in class and in the hostel.

By now, I have noticed something important.

P is also a hosteller.

Hope rises. Confidence does not.

And then… the day arrives.

The canteen is loud. Dinner-time chaos.

I am sitting near the cafeteria door, playing Truth or Dare with friends — a game invented solely to ruin lives.

P walks past with her group.

She has a white towel draped over her head.

One of my friends, M, notices me staring at her with what can only be described as a criminal amount of affection in my eyes.

The bottle spins.

It lands on me.

I choose Dare — because I am an optimist and, clearly, stupid.

M smiles.

“You see that girl with the towel on her head?
Go ask her why it’s there.”

I know it is embarrassing.

But teenage hormones and reactivated puberty confidence are a dangerous combination.

I stand up.

I whisper to myself, “Here goes nothing.”

I walk up to her, tiptoeing like that will somehow help.

“Hey.”

She looks at me. Confused.

P: “Yeah?”

Me:
“Why do you ha—hab—have a towel on your head?”

(Internally screaming.)

She looks me dead in the eyes, visibly annoyed, and says:

“Why do you think it’s there?”

I panic.

“I’m sorry, I know why it’s there, it was a dare, sorryyyyyyy!”

And I run.

I do not recover.
I do not follow up.
I leave the scene entirely.

To this day, this remains my strongest and worst opening line EVER.

Later, M casually informs me:

“Oh, by the way… she’s my dorm-mate.”

I hate you, M.

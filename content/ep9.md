Time moves forward.

My girlfriend — now my ex — moves on.

(She finds someone else and blames me. Fair.)

I wasn’t a fan of long-distance anyway.

I move to Pune as work-from-home ends.

Then immediately resign to find another WFH job.

Worth it.

A girl in my co-living PG is interested in me.

In me.

This is confusing.

At the time, I look like a potato with facial bruises.

When I tell my friends, they say:

“Oh no.
My dessert is deserting.”

We become friends.

I hesitate.

I don’t pursue anything.

I don’t know why — except I do.

P’s birthday approaches again.

This time, I’m earning.
Single.
Certain.

I want to give her a gift.

After many refusals, we settle on makeup.

She lives far away.

So I send her the money.

Thank you, Security Deposit Arc, for making this possible.

It feels good — giving her something I earned myself.

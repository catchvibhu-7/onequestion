P was takling one of the biggest challenge of her life.

Things went sideways.
College issues. Stress was up.

Seeing her stressed, stressed me.

I again tried to helped however I could.

Eventually, things settled.

She got busy — classes, part-time work.

<u>(You might notice the episodes getting shorter.)</u>

Snaps stopped.
Texts slowed.

We talked less.

I felt it more.

It hurt.

But seeing her happy made it bearable, 

**It was all I could ask her for.**

P moves to the place she’s been dreaming of.

I switch jobs.
I grow, slowly.

The distance feels final.

I assume this is where my feelings finally rest.

Then she calls me.

From a railway station.

She shows me her new world.

And suddenly it makes sense.

*Why I never tried again.*
*Why I hesitated every time.*

*It was her.*

*It had always been her.*

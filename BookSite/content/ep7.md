After almost a year of not really talking, and realising P still occupies a permanent section of my brain, I decide avoidance has officially stopped working.

I choose courage.

Or desperation.

Or both.

I decide to talk to P again.

Yes — I discuss this with my girlfriend at the time.
The logic was simple (and flawed):

If I become friends with P again, I’ll finally get over her.

Also, I have a girlfriend, so obviously no funny business.

(Narrator voice: He was wrong.)

After many failed walk-pasts and aborted conversations…

P’s birthday arrives.

She’s walking past me.

“Hey, P.”

She turns.

“Hey, V. Long time.”

“HAPPY BIRTHDAY.”

She smiles.
Says thank you.
And hugs me.

That’s it.

That’s all it took.

The awkwardness evaporates.
My nervous system resets.

The Great Reset.

Things don’t go back to normal instantly — but they do, eventually.

That’s why I never forget her birthday.
It’s special to me in a way I’ve never explained before.

Lunches return.
Conversations return.
Comfort returns.

I’m happy.

Sometimes jealous — because during our time apart, she grew closer to others and I felt a little left behind.

But that’s on me.

She keeps some distance.
So do I.

We keep our feelings on a leash.

Mostly.

Life moves on.

I decide I can’t keep being pathetic.

We barely talk. Sometimes we actively ignore each other.

So I do what any sensible college student would do.

I try to move on.

I date someone else — partly because I wanted to experience it at least once, and partly because I needed proof that I was capable of moving forward.

Things are… fine.

And yet — inconveniently —

You continue living rent-free in the back of my head.

I realise this during one of my many bad decisions:

Drunk. Overconfident. Again.

I admit it out loud.

In front of my girlfriend.

Yes. That happened.

God knows why she stayed with me.

I certainly don’t.

And now P unknowingly knows why she sometimes caught looks from someone across the room.

Despite The Incident, we share classes.

Given that I have already delivered one unforgettable first impression, I decide to try again.

I introduce myself properly.

“You remember me, right?”

To my surprise, she is completely unbothered — or just very good at hiding it — and says hi back.

That is it.
I cannot let this slip again.

We start talking. Slowly. Daily.

Confidence builds.

I get her number.

YESSSSSS.

I celebrate internally like this is a major achievement.

(It is not.
Her number was already in the class group.
I was dumb.)

Texting begins.

I quickly realise she is not a big texter.

So whenever conversations start drying up, I deploy my emergency backup plan:

She likes anime.
I like anime.

(Yes, I listened very carefully during orientation.)

I throw anime into the conversation pot.

Shockingly — it works.

Eventually, she trusts me enough to offer me the Holy Grail.

Her hard disk.
Full of anime.

She tells me she does not share this with anyone.

This is not a small feat.

I am honoured.

This is also how I get introduced to my favourite anime of all time:

One Piece.

My personality levels up slightly.

Thank you for that, P.
